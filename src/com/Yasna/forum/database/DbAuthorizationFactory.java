/**
 * A subclass of AuthorizationFactory for the default Yazd implementation. It makes an
 * SQL query to the Yazd user table to see if the supplied username and password
 * match a user record. If they do, the appropaite Authorization token is
 * returned. If no matching User record is found an UnauthorizedException is
 * thrown.<p>
 *
 * Because each call to createAuthorization(String, String) makes a database
 * connection, Authorization tokens should be cached whenever possible. When
 * using a servlet or JSP skins, a good method is to cache the token in the
 * session. The SkinUtils.getUserAuthorization() methods automatically handles
 * this logic.<p>
 *
 * If you wish to integrate Yazd with your own user system, you'll need to
